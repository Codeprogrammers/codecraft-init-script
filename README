mcramdisk:
----------
This script won't work unless the $USERNAME variable is set to root.
You can allow it to be run by other users if you give said users
permission to use the 'mount' command (but this poses security risks).

Also, be careful with the 'mcramdisk reset' command while your minecraft
server is running. Under normal circumstances, you should NEVER need to 
use this command. But, in the event that you need to clean the directory
for whatever reason, it serves as a quick means of doing so. It's better
than using rm -f since you don't need to provide a location. :D

Keep in mind though: running your minecraft instance in a ramdisk is not
a fail-safe security practice. One needs only gain command-line access
to your server to kill your running instance of minecraft (assuming you
gave the user account declared in the $USERNAME variable in the mcramdisk
script the permission to use 'mount'. If not, they'd obviously still need
to gain root access). Not to mention that a ramdisk will guarantee a loss
of data in the event of a power outages or system crash.

Therefor, children, always be sure to make backups at least bi-hourly when
storing sensitive data on a ramdisk.

Luckily, the 'minecraft' init script is (or will be soon) set up to make
backups of sensitive data every 15 minutes. Though it will (or soon will
be) configurable in that respect.

This has been a friendly lesson in cyber security by Toasty27.
